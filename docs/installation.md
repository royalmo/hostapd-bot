# Project installation

This document contains all the required steps to install this application
in a **Raspberry Pi 4**. It should be compatible with most Raspberry Pi models
and Debian systems, and it may also work with other GNU/Linux distributions.

## Requirements

You need a system with:

- A WiFi antenna. Ours is `wlan0` (replace with yours in the commands below).
- Another device that can provide internet to your system. For example, an
  Ethernet port or another WiFi antenna. In our case we used `eth0`.
